<p>Majority of data is expressed as text format such as news articles, SNS and speech. Each article has some meanings and opinions, which have significant effects on things around us like economics, politics, etc. Therefore, using these information for prediction systems is important. Most of prediction algorithms, however, take input in the form of tensor (1st-order tensor is vector), which requires us to represent text data in the tensor(vector) form. In this article, we review popular three vector representation: Bag or Words, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec. Then, we compare these qualities through sentiment analysis for movie reviews of <a href="http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment">IMDb</a> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>Reinforcement learning has recently been succeeded to go over the human's ability in video games and Go. This implies possiblities to beat human's performance in other fields where human is doing well. Stock trading can be one of such fields. Some professional  In this article, we consider application of reinforcement learning to stock trading. Especially, we work on constructing a portoflio to make profit. Since portfolio can take inifinite number, we tackle this task based on Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). The behavior of stock prices is konwn to depend on history and several time scales, which leads us to use multiscale CNN for Q and actor network. We show that our algorithm has better performance than monkey trading(taking actions at random).</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->

<p>Economic indicators are statistics to measure growth and contraction of economics. Trading based on such indicators, what is called technical trading, is one of the main trends in recent stock trading. Especially S&P500;(Standard and Poor's 500 Index) is frequently used as a bench mark to evaluate portfolio -- a grouping of financial assets like stocks. Roughly speaking, constructing a portfolio with better return and lower risk than S&P500; is one of the main goals for stock trading. Therefore, clarifying the relation between S&P500; and stock prices are important to construct a good portfolio.</p> </div><!-- /.entry-content -->
