    "In prediction tasks, given data does not necessary consist of only useful information. The data may contain irrelevant features, which impairs the performance of a predictor due to overfitting. This situation is often the case for medical data. Sometimes, only a few hundreds of samples are available while we have thousands of features. In this case, we have to extract a small subset of effective features to reduce computational costs and overfitting. Random forest is one of the popular predictors due to the robustness. As one of the useful byproducts, random forests are able to estimate how much each feature has an effect on a performance of the forests. Thus, random forests give us one of possible approaches to reduce the number features to use. In this article, we work on a binary classification task of [“Dorothea Data Set” from UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dorothea). We show that features selected by random forests are efficient not only for random forests  themselves but also for logistic regression."

    "Random forests has been introduced by Breiman in [the paper](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf) in 2001. He proposed collecting many classification and regression trees(CART) and used them to establish better predictors. The key concept of random forests is bagging introduced by Breiman in [the paper](rhttp://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/421.pdf) in 1994. The name comes from the combination of acronym of two words: bootstrap and aggregating. Bagging has been succeeded to improve unstable predictors like neural network and CART. By applying bagging to CART, we obtain the better accuracy tree, random forests. As one of the useful byproducts, we can use random forests to measure importance of each input feature.  We explain these concepts in the following order: bootstrap, bagging, and random forests."

    "Bagging has been introduced by Breiman in [the paper](rhttp://statistics.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/tech-reports/421.pdf). He used bootstrap sampling to improve the accuracy of unstable predictors. The concept is quite simple. Consider a predictor trained by training set $\\mathcal{L}$. For each input $x$, prediction can be expressed as $\\varphi(x, \\mathcal{L})$. For regression case, we can define the aggregated predictor as \n",

Skewed class distribution, however, cause too little detecting the smaller occupation side. This comes from the learning architecture. In most cases, we use a non skewed cost function like binary cross entropy in the learning stage, which makes outputs incline to the negative side.To avoid this, we have to set threshold as a hyper parameter.

Taking TPR and FPR as y-axis and axis respectively, the measure visualize the performance of a predictor with plot along with various thresholds. This plot is called ROC Curve.

    "Results labeled “*_shuffle” correspond to AUC scores of predictors with randomly chosen input features.  Logistic regression with selected features almost reached the peak around 100 features as well as random forests. With more features, logistic regression had rather worse performance. Compared to the scores of “*_shuffle”,  we saw that predictors with selected features had significantly better performance with small number of features."

    "We worked on feature selection with random forests for [“Dorothea Data Set”](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Dorothea), and evaluated the effectiveness with random forest itself and logistic regression. Only 100 out of 100000 features could reach the almost the best performance for both algorithms. Especially, logistic regression had better performance with small number of features through avoiding overfitting coming from the high dimensional input. This result imply the possibility that the importance of feature could be applied to other algorithms with high dimensional input. "
