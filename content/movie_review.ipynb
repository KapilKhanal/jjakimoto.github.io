    "Majority of data is expressed as text format such as news articles, SNS and speech. Each article has some meanings and opinions, which have significant effects on things around us like economics, politics, etc. Therefore, using these information for prediction systems is important. Most of prediction algorithms, however, take input in the form of tensor (1st-order tensor is vector), which requires us to represent text data in the tensor(vector) form. In this article, we review popular three vector representation: Bag or Words, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec. Then, we compare these qualities through sentiment analysis for movie reviews of [IMDb](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment).  Then, we conclude that Doc2Vec is an efficient representation."

    "2. Kardashian actually likes playing baseball better than tennis.\n",

Though this representation is clearly oversimplification, it has been popular because of good performance. \n",

While the current word vector is determined by the summation of forward and backward word vectors  in CBOW model, the certain range forward and backward word vectors are determined by the current word vector in skip-gram model. Both models use log linear model to reduce the computational complexity by getting rid of non-linear hidden layer. T.

    "In most of applications like sentiment analysis, we are required to extract features from one sentence or paragraph. Though the Word2Vec has succeeded to grab semantic features of each word, they have poor performance when converting features of words into those of a paragraph through average over a document or CNN. As a sort of extensions, Q. Le and T. Mikolov have developed Doc2Vec, which extract features from various length one sentence or paragraph and produces fixed-length feature representation. In [the paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053v2.pdf), they have introduced two kind vector representations: Distributed Memory version of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DM) and Distributed Bag of Words version of Paragraph Vectors (PV-DBOW). \n",

    "In this section, we compare quality of vector representations introduced in the previous section. We use IMDb review data fetched from http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment. This data contains 100000 review, which can be divided into two folds: 50000 labeled and 50000 unlabeled reviews. The labeled reviews is able to split further into 25000 positive reviews scored from 7 to 10 out of 10 and 25000 negative reviews scored from 1 to 4 out of 10. Unlabeled reviews do not have any scores. We use half labeled reviews, 25000 reviews, consisting of 12500 positive and 12500 negative for train data and the other half for test data. Unlabeled data is used for unsupervised training of Word2Vec and Doc2Vec. In this experiment, we work on a binary classification problem to predict if unseen data is classified to positive or negative. \n",

First of all, we  have to load text data in the form of one of the classes of implemented at gensim.models.doc2vec, TaggedDocument, which has two attributes: words and tags. Words and tags have to be lists of strings. Note that we have to assign unique tag for each document; otherwise, we end up replacing old data with new data when they have the same tag. \n",
    "\n",
    "When loading data, we set two parameters: ‘remove_stopwords’ and ‘remove_special’. Roughly speaking, stop words are frequent words with unimportant meanings; e.g., a, the, and you. Getting rid of these words often improve the performance. In this experiments, we get rid of stop words for all three representation. ‘remove_special’ refers to if we use special characters such as ‘?’, ‘!’, and ‘,’. Since special characters are included in [the paper introducing Doc2Vec](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.4053v2.pdf), we set ‘remove_special = False’ only for Doc2Vec. "
