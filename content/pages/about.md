Hi, Iâ€™m Tomoaki Fujii, a data scientist at Hedgeable.Inc in NYC. I was grown up and studied in Japan. After finishing my master in applied mathematics at Kyoto University, I moved to the U.S. to work as a software engineer.
I love learning every kind of science and technology, and am going to update here what I have learned.

Other than engineering, I love traveling, running, and various kinds of sports. Especially for running, I've been working on achieving sub three. I would be happy if I could share experiences on these kind of topics.
