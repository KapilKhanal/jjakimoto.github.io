Hi, I am Tomoaki Fujii, a data scientist at a fintech start up, [Hydrogen](https://www.hydrogenplatform.com/) in NYC. Born in the U.S. and raised up in Japan. After finishing my master in applied mathematics at Kyoto University, I moved back to the U.S.

This blog intends to sum up and share what I have learned in technology space, especially around machine learning.

There are a lot of other awesome machine learning blogs briefly explaining complicated stuff. I list out some of them [here](../pages/links). I highly recommend you to check them out.

Instead of overlapping their articles, I would liked to focus on the application side like development of algorithms as actual code.
I would be happy if I could share cool stuffs with you.

Thanks for visiting!
