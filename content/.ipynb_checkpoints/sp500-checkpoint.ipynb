    "Economic indicators are statistics to measure growth and contraction of economics. Trading based on such indicators, what is called technical trading, is one of the main trends in recent stock trading. Especially S&P500(Standard and Poor's 500 Index) is frequently used as a bench mark to evaluate portfolio -- a grouping of financial assets like stocks. Roughly speaking, constructing a portfolio with better return and lower risk than S&P500 is one of the main goals for stock trading. Therefore, clarifying the relation between S&P500 and stock prices are important to construct a good portfolio."
