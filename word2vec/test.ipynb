       "u'Most reviews say that this is the weakest point in Hamilton s short movie career  This movie is a bit different from the rest  and considering it the best or the worst depends on what you expect from a movie  and what you expect from Hamilton Knowing Hamilton as a photographer  you can be slightly surprised  While Bilitis looks like his books in a movement with all those young girls discovering themselves and relations with each other on the edge of lesbian  with a plot connecting these scenes  Laura concentrates on few characters what enables developing relations among them  male female  artist model  but though we see beautiful photos  many of them better than his average  their number is reduced for the sake of the plot  Tendres cousines is different from both  it is only Hamilton s movie that looks more like a film than like a collection of moving photos  Because of that it can be acceptable to wider audience than Hamilton s fans  looking like an erotic comedy  but not German soft core type    Schulm dchen report  fans would be very disappointed   You won t laugh a lot  but you can smile  and that s something you don t often get from Hamilton   Unlike all other Hamilton s movies the age of female varies  Unlike other movies main character is a boy  Unlike his usual works this one isn t put out of place and out of time  We have characters that live their life  have their destiny and don t lead us only from one photo to another  from one nude girl to another Unfortunately  Hamilton  again  gets lost with a script in his hands  Girls on beaches  under shower  in low light rooms  in gardens  under tents  in front of mirrors  regardless of the amount of clothes   this is his territory  he can shoot minutes and hours  and whatever he does you ll always feel the artist s eye and hand behind it  But when he has to present us average everyday life he stops being Hamilton and becomes average director who just follows the script  Hamilton is best known for his nudes  but they are just a part of his work  And in Tendres cousines we have a reverse situation  his girls are not in the best shots  Nature  garden  house remind us on Hamilton s work  often neglected part of it   while girls  even when nude  don t have anything special in the way he presents us  Maybe Hamilton was confused having a boy in front of camera  maybe he was thinking about a line that censorship would accept  maybe he was really trying to make something new  and no one dared to tell him he shouldn t   but he neglected what he was mostly praised for '"
